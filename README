I wanted to create a digial photo frame using a raspberry Pi.

I saw a tutorial online that was so convoluted, I thought "I can do
better than that. It only needs a web page and a little Javascript"

So here's my slide show app.

The CSS is based on http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp, 
stripped down to only include what I need.

       

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Pre-requisites:
        * Linux/Mac (because the setup script is a shell script); if you want
          to get this working on Windows, please see what setup.sh does
          and feel free to let me know
        * Python
        * Virtualenv

    setup:
        run the shellscript "setup.sh" (it doesn't need root access)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Copy the "default_settings.py" and save the copy as "settings.py".
  Edit "settings.py" according to your needs.

  run the program "make_slideshow.py" to create some HTML.

  (Optional) Copy the HTML and the images to the system you're using as
  your digial photo frame

  By default, and images in the folder called "images" will be added
  to the slideshow. They will be displayed in alphanumeric order.

  When the page first loads, it will tell you the size of the browser
  window. To see the full-screen window size, press F11 to maximise the
  browser, then F5 to reload the page.

  Crop your photos to match the height of the screen on the target system.
  (particularly if you're using a Raspberry Pi where processing power to 
  handle large images may be limited)


Further suggestions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o  Config to specify animation type: slide in from L/R/T/B, zoom, spin etc.

  o  Fade out image at end of display interval (currently it's instant-off)

  o  ability to add captions to any photo

  o  ability to add a block of HTML instead of a full-screen image.

  o  custom transitions, custom delays for individual photos

  o  Things to make it super-easy to run on a Raspberry Pi

  o  Utility to scale images to optimise for the output size. (Imagemagick script?)

  o  Utility to crop/pad images to the right aspect ratio. (Imagemagick script?)
